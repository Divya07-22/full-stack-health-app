## Getting Started ðŸš€

To get a local copy up and running, you need to set up both the backend and the frontend.

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js & npm:** For the frontend. Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
* **Python 3:** For the backend. Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
* **pip:** Python package installer.

### Backend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```sh
    cd backend
    ```
2.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: You may need to create a `requirements.txt` file from the imported libraries in `app.py` if one doesn't exist. The main libraries are `flask`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `flask-cors`)*

3.  **Run the Flask server:**
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```
    The backend server will start on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory in a new terminal:**
    ```sh
    cd frontend
    ```
2.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Run the React app:**
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
    The frontend development server will start, usually on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Once both the backend and frontend servers are running, you can open your browser to `http://localhost:3000` to use the application.
